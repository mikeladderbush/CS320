To make sure my code or software works well and stays safe, I focus on testing it thoroughly. I run different types of tests to catch any issues early on, like making sure each part of the code works on its own and checking how everything fits together. I also pay attention to security by regularly updating and checking for vulnerabilities. Simple practices like following secure coding guidelines and having others review my code help me make sure it's all good.

When it comes to understanding what users want and putting it into the program, I like to talk with them and gather all the details. I make sure to write down everything they need and want the software to do. I find that getting feedback from users as I work on the program helps me make changes and improvements along the way. For designing software, I start with a clear plan and break it down into smaller parts. This helps me create a flexible system that's easier to understand. I also like to show prototypes to users early on, so I can adjust things based on their input and make sure the final product is user-friendly.
